            <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Create and research an application used by Kennedy Krieger Center for Autism and Related Disorders children to address the main concept of self-Advocacy in students for health.
             
                <p>The application is for the children to improve self advocacy by letting them go through a questionaire along side with a game to grow and nurture plants and give them a reason to come back to the application on the daily basis which could keep track of their health.The children wouldn't know that they are scrutinised and would be honest about the how they feel everyday and this way the teachers  could keep a track of the childrens health.</p>

            After the Interview session  with the mentor at the Kennedy Krieger Institute,it was so that children enjoyed using their the ipads and was comfortable with it .And I decided to design an application for the Ipad or any tablet.Initial design was to involve more pictures and lesser text to engage the students with the application.Based on these requirements , Had to design the wireframe.
